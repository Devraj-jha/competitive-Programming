//i have decided to learn time complexity in detail
//so I will study time complexity 
//time complexity is the way to descibe how fast an algo run based on input size.
//0(1) => doesn't depend on input size
//o(log n) => fast even for large input
// like these there are notation
//we study to understand how will input become when we increase size of input.
