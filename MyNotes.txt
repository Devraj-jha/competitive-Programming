 >>const the immutable qualifier.

 when you run a cpp code,
 there are two main times when things can be computed;

 compile time => when complier is turning .cpp => bin
 run time => when programe is actually running 

 if something is evaluted at complie time, 
 code runs faster. compiler tries to figure out its value 
 before,
