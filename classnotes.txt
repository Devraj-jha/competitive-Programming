//a way of looking, at problems by imagining the world.
oops. => 
        =>procedural programming, data(method) + behaviours(method).
        ex - for student, attributes -> name, roll number, marks,
            => behaviours => study, give exam

oops => it is the programming, paradigm, that implements, object oritend thinking using 
c#, cpp, java
encapuslation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, -> main pillars,

encapuslation, => wrapping data and methods together,
abstraction => showing only essential data
inheritance => returning properties and behaviours
polymorphism = same action can behave differently 

oops thinking -> this is the mindset of way of analysising.
oops programming => pratcial coding apporach on that behaivour.

comparison between 
oops            
programming done by creating object.
(2) data and functions are kept toegther inside the class.
(3)java, python, cpp
(4)more secure
(5)code resuablity through inheritance and polmorphism .
(6) easier to manage large and complex project'


Procedural programming.
(1) programming is done by functions that operates on data. 
(2) Data and functions are kept separately.
(3) ex - c, paskal, fortan
(4) programe is divide into funciton 
(5) less secure
(6) code resuablity through function only.
(7) complex for large project.

Features of oops paradigm, 
+> objects, classes, encapsulation,abstraction, inheritance, polmorphism , message passing, 
modularity,
Advantage --> real world modelling, reusablity, scablitity and maintainable. 
              data secrutiy, flexibility, productivity, team collabration, 

Disadvantage --> complexity, slower execution, memory usage, not always suitable.


process of taking data and showing results.
in object oriented program. input and output are handled through object and classes.
cin >> , cout << ,
cpp uses cin = standarad input , cout => standard output.

in java,
java provides classes and methods for input output.
system.out.println = used for output
standard input steam
encapsulation = input output handeled via objects
polymorphism= operator and functions work with multiple data type
reusability= input output classes can be used in multiple programs 
simple and user friendly, works consistently with all data types
object oriented design that can be easy to extend,
error handling is easier
